# Flask WebApp Integration with MongoDB database

This is a simple looking flask code but has lot's of conditions written .

*The webapp is like the driver to mongodb engine running bts on windows . The flask webapp is capable of allowing the client to create,update,remove,fetch an entire database , collection and data in it .*

### db.py
_this program file has flask code wriiten that will launch a webapp that will work as the driver for the mongoDB server running behind the scene._

### templates
_It contains all the required html files required by flask to forward and get the request._

**NOTE** 
*Here flask is working on 'GET' operation , instead you can use 'POST' operation too !!*
